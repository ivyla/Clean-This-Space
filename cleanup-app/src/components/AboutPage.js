          Clean This Space is a web platform for facilitating environmentalist
          efforts by connecting patrons and community organizers to passionate
          activists on the field. If there is a public area that you feel needs
          attention, whether it be in your own community, or one-thousand miles
          away, you can contribute by attending and organizing events, or by
          supporting crowd-funded conservation efforts. Clean This Space makes
          it easy to bridge the gap between passion and action. Clean This Space
          is a grassroots movement gone worldwide!
