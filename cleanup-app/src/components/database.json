The unfortunate situation: the beach has seen better days. As a popular spot for weekend bonfire parties, surfing, and hiking, this lovely beach gets a lot of traffic; however, the community's reluctance to \"pack out\" their trash means that there is now a collection of glass bottles and solo cups littering the shore. Our goal for the day is to collect 25 pounds of trash!",
